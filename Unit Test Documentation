   -The program throws "Argument Error", as no value is given for s.

2. ["-h"]
   -The program throws "Argument Error", as h is not defined as a part of schema.

3. ["-q *"]
   -The program doesn't throw any error, but while printing stringArray displays [build] in place of [*].

4. ["-x -qwerty"]

==Test Handled

1. ["-f -sn aditya 7"]
   - Original Behaviour: 
     The program was initially setting value of f as true, s as richa and n as 48.
   - After Modification:
     The program throws "Unexpected Argument" error on giving above input.
   - Code Added: 
     Implemented a check inside parseArgumentStrings method of "StringArgumentParser.java", to check that string 
     length after "-" is 1.
   
2. ["-qwerty"]
   
   - After Modification: 
     The program throws "Unexpected Argument" error on giving above input.
   - Modifications made: 
     Implemented a check inside parseArgumentStrings method of "StringArgumentParser.java", to check that string 
     length after "-" is 1.
                                                  
3. ["$"]
   - Original Behaviour: 
     The program was initially not giving any error, but setting everything to default value.
   - After Modification:
     The program throws Unexpected Argument error on giving above input.
   - Code Added: 
     Implemented a check inside parseArgumentStrings method of "StringArgumentParser.java", to check that string 
     argument string should start with "-"
                         
4. ["--"]
   - Original Behaviour: 
     The program was initially setting value deafult values for all variables.
   - After Modification: 
     The program throws Unexpected Argument error on giving above input.
   - Code Added: 
     Implemented a check inside parseArgumentStrings method of "StringArgumentParser.java", to check that string 
     length after "-" is 1 and argument should be valid.
                         
5. ["- -"]
   - Original Behaviour: 
     The program was initially setting value deafult values for all variables.
   - After Modification: 
     The program throws Unexpected Argument error on giving above input.
   - Code Added: 
     Implemented a check inside parseArgumentStrings method of "StringArgumentParser.java", to check that string 
     length after "-" is 1 and argument should be valid.
